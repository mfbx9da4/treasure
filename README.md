## Description

The aim of [this game](http://treasure.surge.sh) is to demonstrate the power of [binary search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) to novice programmers. The user should first try and create a strategy for finding the treasure. Most likely the user will stumble upon a strategy very similar to binary search. Try starting with a [one dimensional array first](http://treasure.surge.sh/?easy).

Binary search strategy can be summarized by: dividing the grid in half each time until you reach one possible cell. The number of times it takes to divide a number in half until you reach one is the definition of log_base_2(N). Therefore using the binary search strategy, the best number of guesses to find the treasure is log_base_2(totalCells). Checkout the [solver tab](http://treasure.surge.sh/?easy) to see binary search in action.

I would like to turn this in to a talk at some point and using the analogy of advent calendars. Here are [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRBbkuDdhR95yGCsAGBmhvL_NXgW0LCnIzM9OO1b-P47Jl2WxpUbKC93f7dI47Hdr7J7Nxjp1ZMi1cF/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
